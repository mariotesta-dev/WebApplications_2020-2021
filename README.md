# WebApplications_2020-2021
This repository contains my works done for the course "Web Applications I" held on Polytechnic University of Turin in academic year 2020/2021.

### Disclaimer:
The code proposed works, but it hasn't been deeply tested and is NOT being updated. Lots of vulnerables emerged, so avoid using these in production. <br/>This doesn't replace teaching material and is just for demonstration purpose.
